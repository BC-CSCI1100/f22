## About

CSCI 1100 Gateway to Computer Science is a 4-credit introductory course in computer science that is designed to prepare students for entry to the computer science curriculum for either a major or a minor in computer science. Though CSCI 1100 credits don't count toward either the major or the minor, the course will position students for success in one of the first course in the CS curriculum, CSCI 1101 Computer Science 1 or CSCI 1103 Computer Science 1 Honors.

CSCI 1100 is centered around **methods for problem solving**, both technical and non-technical. We'll learn  how to develop repetitive algorithms for problem solving and how to break problems into manageable parts, such that an assembly of the solutions to the parts yields a solution to the whole problem. We'll also develop tools and methods for getting unstuck when we're stuck.

With an eye toward downstream courses in the CS curriculum, we'll focus on three areas:

1.  Learning how to code --- we'll use the Python programming language,
2.  Learning how to work with computer systems
    1.  we'll become proficient with the unix command line interface and the bash shell,
    2.  we'll learn how to use git repositories and how to share them with GitHub.

3.  Learning some mathematical tools that have proven to be helpful in problem solving, we'll learn about sets and relations, numeral systems, we'll review some trigonometry and geometry.

##### Methods

CSCI 1100 is an immersion course, we'll be learning about computation by immersing ourselves in Python code. The first order of business is to learn how to code. By way of demonstration, we'll be covering a lot of Python code in class. Our starting point will be familiar to anyone experienced with basic high-school algebra. Using this as our foundation, we'll introduce new programming concepts and constructs, step by step, until we've covered most of the tools available to programmers developing small-scale programs (involving what are called procedural abstractions). Our first programs will have between say 10 and 20 lines of code. By the end of the semester we'll be able to manage programs with a few hundred lines of code.
Like playing a musical instrument, coding is a skill that can only be developed with practice. Learning to code is hard work but, as you'll find, getting a piece of software to work is extremely satisfying.

CSCI 1100 Gateway to Computer Science meets Monday thru Thursday, 2PM - 2:50PM in Stokes North, Rm 215.

##### Screens When and Where

Though we'll be using our laptops regularly in CSCI 1100, we'll only be using them for the purposes of workshop exercises and problem solving. Otherwise we'll have screen-less classrooms. This means that **no open laptops, tablets, or smart-phones will be allowed in class**. All lecture notes and sample programs will be posted to the course website.

+ **If you have special circumstances that require you to use your laptop during class, please see me.**
